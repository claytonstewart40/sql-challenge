# sql-challenge

Overview

Joining Pewlett Hackard as a new data engineer, your initial major task involves conducting a research project on employees from the 1980s and 1990s, utilizing the remnants of the employee database from that era, which now exists in six CSV files. This project will encompass data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis to effectively manage and interpret the historical employee data.

Getting Started

Repository Setup

Repository Name: sql-challenge

Local Setup: Clone the repository to your computer.

Directory Structure: Create a directory within the repository named EmployeeSQL, tailored to this specific challenge.

Files

Module 9 Challenge Files: Essential for beginning the project, containing the CSV files and other necessary resources.

Instructions

Data Modeling

Objective: Inspect the CSV files and draft an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) to visualize the database structure. Tools like QuickDBD may be utilized for this purpose.

Data Engineering

Table Schema Creation: Define a table schema for each of the six CSV files, ensuring to specify data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints. Considerations include:

Ensuring primary keys are unique or establishing composite keys if necessary.

Creating tables in an order that respects foreign key relationships.

Importing each CSV file into its respective SQL table.

Data Analysis

Perform various SQL queries to extract specific data points, such as:

Employee details including salaries.

Employees hired in 1986.

Department managers and their details.

Department numbers and names for each employee.

Employees named Hercules with last names starting with "B".

Employees in the Sales department.

Employees in both Sales and Development departments.

Frequency counts of employee last names, in descending order of frequency.

Submission Details

Analysis Output: Your submissions should include the ERD sketch, the SQL table schemas, and the SQL queries used for the analysis.

GitHub: Ensure all relevant files, including the ERD, schema, and query files, are added to the EmployeeSQL folder and pushed to GitHub.

Conclusion

This README provides a comprehensive guide to undertaking the SQL Challenge at Pewlett Hackard, focusing on historical employee data from the 1980s and 1990s. Through data modeling, engineering, and analysis, you will uncover insights within the data, demonstrating the practical application of SQL in managing and analyzing complex datasets.
